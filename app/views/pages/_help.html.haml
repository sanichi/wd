  To become a registered user of the site you need to acquire a username and password
  from the webmaster (whose contact details should be on the
  = t("contact.contacts")
  page). The different types of users are as follows:
%ul
  %li
    %b= t("user.roles.member")
    Can view the contact details of all players (whereas ordinary visitors to the
    site can only see the contact details of the principals - president, treasurer,
    team captains etc).
  %li
    %b= t("user.roles.blogger")
    Can create news items and edit those they have previously created themselves.
    Similarly for games.
  %li
    %b= t("user.roles.librarian")
    Manages the information we keep on our book collection.
  %li
    %b Administrator
    Manages players, contacts and users and
    and can edit any item to maintain the

    fill in

      %li
        %b= t("blog.title")
        Keep this short and snappy.
      %li
        %b= t("blog.summary")
        Keep this fairly short. It's for the home page when the item is still recent.
      %li
        %b= t("blog.story")
        Optional. This is where you put the bulk of your news item unless it's very short.
      %li
        %b= t("blog.draft")
        Leave this checked to begin with to prevents the item being published to the home
        page or the list of news items before it's been perfected.

    if you need to make any corrections, then
    %ul
      %li

    = link_to "Markdown", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown", target: "external"
  If there are any features you're unsure how to write (in practice, the only tricky
  things are tables), the easiest thing to do is see how someone else has done it.
  To view the raw Markdown of any other news item:
%ul
  %li
    click
    %b= t("blog.blogs")
  %li click on the title of the news item with the feature you're interested in
  %li
    click
    %b= t("blog.markdown")
    (this button is in the bottom left and you need to be signed in to use it)

%h4{id: "create_game"}= "Create a Game"

%p
  For this you need to have a
  = link_to "PGN", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation", target: "external"
  file of the game.
%ul
  %li= t("session.sign_in").downcase

    %b= t("game.new")
  %li
    fill in
    %ul
      %li
        %b= t("game.title")
        You can leave this blank and let the system guess one from info in the PGN.
      %li
        %b= t("game.pgn")
      %li
        %b= t("game.difficulty")
        Only for problems and studies (PGN files with a non-initial
        = succeed(").") do
          = link_to "FEN", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation", target: "external"
  %li
    if you need to make any corrections, then
    %ul
      %li
        click
        %b= t("edit")
      %li make corrections
      %li
        click
        %b= t("save")
%p
  Note that the system is quite strict about syntax and may reject your PGN as invalid.
  If this happens and you can't figure out why, please contact the webmaster.

%h4{id: "house_style"}= "House Style"

%p
  To maintain a consistent look to news items and games, bloggers are encouraged to
  keep in mind the following guidance:
%ul
  %li
    = t("blog.blogs")
    %ul
      %li keep blog summaries (meant for the home page) short
      %li use relative URLs for internal links (see below)
      %li use a target for off site links (see below)
      %li use ½-½ for draws and not 0.5-0.5 or 1/2-1/2
      %li for match scores don't use decimals (e.g. prefer 3½-2½ to 3.5-2.5)
  %li
    = t("game.games")
    %ul
      %li use ½-½ and not 0.5-0.5 in titles (obviously in PGN you must use 1/2-1/2)

%h6 Use Relative URLs for Internal Links
%p
  In a news item you should link to other pages of this site with a relative URL.
  For example to link to game number 123 use something like this Markdown:
%pre [this great game](/games/123)
%p as opposed to this:
%pre [this great game](https://wanderingdragonschess.club/games/123)
%p
  The reason is that this site has a second domain (www.wanderingdragonschess.club).
  If a user signed in to one domain followed a link to the other one, they would
  no longer be signed in. Using relative links keeps everyone on the same domain.

%h6 Use Targets for External Links
%p
  We want links to external pages to open a new tab in the user's browser instead
  of replacing our site's page. The normal way to achieve this effect in HTML is
  to add a target to the link but Markdown is so simplified it can't do this (and
  note that, for security, we don't allow users to insert fragments of HTML into Markdown).
  However, we have customised our Markdown processor to achieve this: just add
  a pipe symbol (|) to the end of the URL as in this example:
%pre [this great site](https://fide.com|)
%p as opposed to this:
%pre [this great site](https://fide.com)

= help_section :book_search

%p
  The search controls are fairly self-explanatory with the exception of:
%ul
  %li
    %b= t("book.year")
    As well as specifying an exact publication year (e.g. "2019") it is also possible to
    specify ranges (e.g. "2000-2010"), or limits (e.g. ">2015" or "<=1996").
  %li
    %b= t("book.borrowers")
    If the word "ALL" is entered here, then instead of searching for specific book
    borrowers by name, this will match all borrowers (i.e. the result will be all
    borrowed books).

= help_section :get_login

%p
  To become a registered user of the site you need to acquire a username and password
  from the webmaster (whose contact details are on the
  = link_to t("contact.contacts"), contacts_path
  page). The different types of users are as follows:
%ul
  %li
    %b= t("user.roles.member")
    Can view the contact details of all players (whereas ordinary visitors to the
    site can only see the contact details of the principals - president, treasurer,
    team captains etc).
  %li
    %b= t("user.roles.blogger")
    Can create news items and games and edit those they have previously created themselves.
  %li
    %b= t("user.roles.librarian")
    Manages the information we keep on our book collection.
  %li
    %b Administrator
    Manages everything else (players, contacts, users, images) and
    can modify anything the other users create.

%ul
  %li= t("session.sign_in").downcase
  %li
    click
    %b= t("blog.blogs")
  %li
    click
    %b= t("blog.new")
  %li
    fill in
    %ul
      %li
        %b= t("blog.title")
        Keep this short and snappy.
      %li
        %b= t("blog.summary")
        Keep this fairly short. It's for the home page when the item is still recent.
      %li
        %b= t("blog.story")
        Optional. This is where you put the bulk of your news item unless it's very short.
      %li
        %b= t("blog.draft")
        Leave this checked to begin with to prevent the item being published before it's ready.
  %li
    if you need to make any corrections, then
    %ul
      %li
        click
        %b= t("edit")
      %li make corrections
      %li
        click
        %b= t("save")
  %li
    when your item is ready for publishing, then
    %ul
      %li
        click
        %b= t("edit")
      %li
        uncheck
        %b= t("blog.draft")
      %li
        click
        %b= t("save")
%p
  Note that the
  = t("blog.summary")
  and
  = t("blog.story")
  are written in
  = succeed(".") do
    = link_to "Markdown", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown", target: "external"
  If there are any features you're unsure how to write (in practice, the only tricky
  things are tables), the easiest thing to do is see how someone else has done it.
  To view the raw Markdown of any other news item:
%ul
  %li
    click
    %b= t("blog.blogs")
  %li click on the title of the news item with the feature you're interested in
  %li
    click
    %b= t("blog.markdown")
    (this button is in the bottom left and you need to be signed in to use it)
%p
  To link to another blog, first find out it's ID number and then
  insert a link something like the following example:
%pre
  [this previous news item](/blogs/2)
%p
  Similarly, for a game (see
  = succeed("),") do
    = help_link(:create_game)
  first find out its ID and then insert something like:
%pre
  [this great game](/games/3)

= help_section :add_image

%p
  To add an image to a news item, send the image to the webmaster and then either (a) ask them
  to add it for you or (b) request a unique filename for the image so you can add it yourself.
  In the latter case, insert something like the following example into your markdown:
%pre
  ![this is a great photo](photo1.jpg "180R")
%p
  The text inside the square brackets is alternative text and doesn't normally display.
  Put the image filename after the opening parenthesis. The text in quotes in regular
  markdown would be the image title but, in this application, is used instead to place
  and resize the image according to the following rules:
%ul
  %li
    by default, the image will be centered but if the letter R (or L) appears,
    it will instead be floated to the right (or left);
  %li
    by default, the image width will be resized to 200 pixels, but if a number
    between 100 and 300 appears then this will be the width, or if a number between
    10 and 100 appears followed by a percent sign, then the width will be this
    fraction of the news item width.

= help_section :create_game

%p
  For this you need to have a
  = link_to "PGN", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation", target: "external"
  file of the game.
%ul
  %li= t("session.sign_in").downcase
  %li
    click
    %b= t("game.games")
  %li
    click
    %b= t("game.new")
  %li
    fill in
    %ul
      %li
        %b= t("game.title")
        You can leave this blank and let the system guess one from info in the PGN.
      %li
        %b= t("game.pgn")
        By copying and pasting your file.
      %li
        %b= t("game.difficulty")
        Only for problems and studies (PGN files with a non-initial
        = succeed(").") do
          = link_to "FEN", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation", target: "external"
  %li
    if you need to make any corrections, then
    %ul
      %li
        click
        %b= t("edit")
      %li make corrections
      %li
        click
        %b= t("save")
%p
  If your PGN is rejected as invalid and you can't figure out why, please contact the webmaster.

= help_section :house_style

%p
  To maintain a consistent look to news items and games, bloggers are encouraged to:
%ul
  %li keep game titles short with template: "surname-surname, event, year, result"
  %li use ½ for draws and match scores (e.g. ½-½, 3½-2½)

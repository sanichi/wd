%p
  To become a registered user of the site you need to acquire a username and password
  from the webmaster (whose contact details will be on the
  = t("contact.contacts")
  page). The different types of users are as follows:
%ul
  %li
    %b= t("user.roles.member")
    Can view the contact details of all players (whereas ordinary visitors to the
    site can only see the contact details of the principals - president, treasurer,
    team captains etc).
  %li
    %b= t("user.roles.blogger")
    Can create news items and edit those they have previously created themselves.
    Similarly for games.
  %li
    %b= t("user.roles.librarian")
    Manages the information we keep on our book collection.
  %li
    %b Administrator
    Manages everything else (players, contacts, users, images) and
    can edit or delete any news item or game.

%ul
  %li= t("session.sign_in").downcase
  %li
    click
    %b= t("blog.blogs")
  %li
    click
    %b= t("blog.new")
  %li
    fill in
    %ul
      %li
        %b= t("blog.title")
        Keep this short and snappy.
      %li
        %b= t("blog.summary")
        Keep this fairly short. It's for the home page when the item is still recent.
      %li
        %b= t("blog.story")
        Optional. This is where you put the bulk of your news item unless it's very short.
      %li
        %b= t("blog.draft")
        Leave this checked to begin with to prevent the item being published before it's ready.
  %li
    if you need to make any corrections, then
    %ul
      %li
        click
        %b= t("edit")
      %li make corrections
      %li
        click
        %b= t("save")
  %li
    when your item is ready for publishing, then
    %ul
      %li
        click
        %b= t("edit")
      %li
        uncheck
        %b= t("blog.draft")
      %li
        click
        %b= t("save")
%p
  Note that the
  = t("blog.summary")
  and
  = t("blog.story")
  are written in
  = succeed(".") do
    = link_to "Markdown", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown", target: "external"
  If there are any features you're unsure how to write (in practice, the only tricky
  things are tables), the easiest thing to do is see how someone else has done it.
  To view the raw Markdown of any other news item:
%ul
  %li
    click
    %b= t("blog.blogs")
  %li click on the title of the news item with the feature you're interested in
  %li
    click
    %b= t("blog.markdown")
    (this button is in the bottom left and you need to be signed in to use it)

= help_section :create_game

%p
  For this you need to have a
  = link_to "PGN", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation", target: "external"
  file of the game.
%ul
  %li= t("session.sign_in").downcase
  %li
    click
    %b= t("game.games")
  %li
    click
    %b= t("game.new")
  %li
    fill in
    %ul
      %li
        %b= t("game.title")
        You can leave this blank and let the system guess one from info in the PGN.
      %li
        %b= t("game.pgn")
      %li
        %b= t("game.difficulty")
        Only for problems and studies (PGN files with a non-initial
        = succeed(").") do
          = link_to "FEN", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation", target: "external"
  %li
    if you need to make any corrections, then
    %ul
      %li
        click
        %b= t("edit")
      %li make corrections
      %li
        click
        %b= t("save")
%p
  Note that the system is quite strict about syntax and may reject your PGN as invalid.
  If this happens and you can't figure out why, please contact the webmaster.

= help_section :house_style

%p
  To maintain a consistent look to news items and games, bloggers are encouraged to
  keep in mind the following guidance:
%ul
  %li
    = t("blog.blogs")
    %ul
      %li keep blog summaries short
      %li use relative URLs for internal links (see below)
      %li use a target for external links (see below)
      %li use ½-½ for draws and not 0.5-0.5 or 1/2-1/2
      %li for match scores don't use decimals (e.g. prefer 3½-2½ to 3.5-2.5)
  %li
    = t("game.games")
    %ul
      %li use ½-½ and not 0.5-0.5 in titles (obviously in PGN you must use 1/2-1/2)

%h6 Use Relative URLs for Internal Links
%p
  In a news item you should link to other pages of this site with a relative URL.
  For example, to link to game number 123 use something like this Markdown:
%pre [this great game](/games/123)
%p as opposed to this:
%pre [this great game](https://wanderingdragonschess.club/games/123)
%p
  The reason is that this site has a second domain (www.wanderingdragonschess.club).
  If a user signed in to one domain followed a link to the other one, they would
  no longer be signed in. Using relative links keeps users on the same domain they
  started on. Also, relative URLs are shorter to type.

%h6 Use Targets for External Links
%p
  We want links to external pages to open a new tab in the user's browser instead
  of replacing our site's page. The normal way to achieve this effect in HTML is
  to add a target to the link but Markdown has no such feature (and note that, for
  security, we don't allow users to insert fragments of HTML into Markdown).
  However, we have customised our Markdown processor in the following way:
  just add a pipe symbol (|) to the end of the URL as in this example:
%pre [this great site](https://fide.com|)
%p as opposed to this (which would lack a target):
%pre [this great site](https://fide.com)

= help_section :todo

%p This site is under construction and there are some features still to implement.
%ul
  %li Create an image collection and allow images to be added to blogs.
  %li Create a books collection.
  %li Allow game variations to be displayed.

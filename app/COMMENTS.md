Please analyze this codebase and create an AGENTS.md file containing:
1. Build/lint/test commands - especially for running a single test
2. Code style guidelines including imports, formatting, types, naming conventions, error handling, etc.

The file you create will be given to agentic coding agents (such as yourself) that operate in this repository. Make it about 20 lines long.
If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include them.

If there's already an AGENTS.md, improve it if it's located in /Users/mjo/Projects/app/wd

I'll analyze the codebase to understand the build commands, code style, and create an AGENTS.md file. Let me start by examining the project structure and key configuration files.

Created `AGENTS.md` with comprehensive guidelines for this Rails 8.0 chess club application. The file includes:

- **Build/Test Commands**: Standard Rails commands including `bin/rake` for full tests and `bin/rspec spec/features/user_spec.rb` for single test files
- **Code Style**: Ruby conventions like snake_case, Rails patterns, single-line method syntax, proper validation usage
- **Key Dependencies**: PostgreSQL, RSpec, CanCanCan, factory_bot
- **Security Practices**: Secure passwords, input validation, authorization patterns

No existing Cursor or Copilot rules were found. The guidelines are based on analyzing the actual codebase patterns from controllers, models, and test files.

Looking at this Rails chess club codebase, I have several observations:

## Positive Aspects
- **Clean Rails conventions**: Follows standard Rails patterns well
- **Security-conscious**: Uses `has_secure_password`, input validation with regex, CanCanCan authorization
- **Good test coverage**: Comprehensive Capybara feature tests with factories
- **Modern Rails**: Uses Rails 8.0 with current best practices
- **Internationalization**: Proper i18n setup with locale files

## Areas for Improvement

**Code Quality:**
- **Missing model specs**: Only feature tests exist, no unit tests for models like `User`
- **Long methods**: Some controller methods could be extracted into service objects
- **Magic numbers**: Constants like `EXPIRES = 4` could use more descriptive names

**Security:**
- **Session handling**: Manual session expiry logic in `current_user` could be simplified with Rails built-ins
- **OTP implementation**: Custom OTP logic instead of established gems like `devise-two-factor`

**Architecture:**
- **Fat models**: `User` model has complex role logic that could be extracted
- **Controller concerns**: Common patterns like error handling could be extracted into concerns
- **Missing service layer**: Business logic mixed into controllers/models

**Dependencies:**
- **Outdated gems**: Some version constraints are quite loose (e.g., `'< 9'` for rspec-rails)
- **Custom PGN gem**: Uses forked version which could create maintenance issues

**Documentation:**
- **Missing API docs**: No controller/model documentation
- **Setup complexity**: Database configuration requires manual `database.yml` creation

The project shows solid Rails fundamentals but could benefit from more modular architecture and comprehensive unit testing.
